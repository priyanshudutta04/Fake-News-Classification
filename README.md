Fake News Classification using Bidirectional LSTM

## About

The Fake News Classification project aims to tackle misinformation using advanced natural language processing techniques. By utilizing a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, this project classifies news articles as either real or fake. The BiLSTM model effectively captures the context of words from both directions in a sentence, making it a powerful tool for detecting fake news. This repository includes all necessary scripts, models, and datasets for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
